During the early part of June, 1901, while near Springfield, Greene
county, Missouri, I had the opportunity of making a few observations
on the habits of _C. neglectus_. In the James river, near Galloway,
about eight miles southeast of Springfield, this was the only species
observed, although probably not the only one occurring in the river.
At this place the James river is a rather swift-flowing stream, with a
rocky bed and with rather high wooded hills along the sides. The stream
is quite shallow in the swiftly running places. The crayfish were quite
abundant, being found under the loose stones and resting in the strands
of the rich vegetation, which stood almost horizontal in the swiftly
flowing water.
